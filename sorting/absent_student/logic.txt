🧩 Problem: “Find the Missing Student’s Roll Number”

You are given an unsorted array of unique roll numbers of students who attended a class.
The roll numbers range from 1 to N, but one student was absent, so one roll number is missing.

Your task is to:

Sort the roll numbers using Bubble Sort.

Use Binary Search to find the missing roll number efficiently.

📥 Input
1. An integer N representing the total number of students.
2. An array arr[] of length N-1, containing distinct integers in the range [1, N].


1. The First Approach (Natural Number Sum - Sum of Array):
- Apply bubble sorting to sort the list O(n*n).
- Calculate sum of the array O(n).
- result = natural sum of N - sum of array.


2. Experimental another approach

given:
N=6
sorted list: [1,2,4,5,6];
missing = 3;

start=0, end=4
mid = 2
midElement = 4;

if(midElement == mid+1) {
    start=mid+1;
} else{
    result = arr[mid]-1;
    end=mid-1;
}

run this wile start<=end; return result, update result every time else block run.


another example
N=6, arr = [1,2,3,4,6];

start=0;
end=4;
mid=2;

midEl = 3;

midEl == mid+1, run :: start=mid+1;

start=3;
end=4;
mid=3;
midEL= 4

midEl== mid+1;, run :: start=mid+1;

start=4;
end=4;
mid=4;
midEl=6;

midEl != mid+1; run :: end=mid-1 result = arr[mid]-1=5;

loop breaks, answer = 5;

2. The Second Approach (Binary Search on Value Set and Index Comparison) :
1. Sort using bubble sorting.
2. Apply Binary search and check for the following conditions:
if(midEl == mid+1) : start=mid+1;
else result = arr[mid]-1;, end=mid-1;
3. run the loop while start<=end;
4. return result.
