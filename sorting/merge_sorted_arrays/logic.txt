we are given the following things:
arr1 = [1,2,3,4,0,0];
m = length of arr1 actual elements without placeholders for arr2 = 4;
arr2 = [5,6];
n = length of ar2 = 2;

the question want us to rewrite arr1 in such a way that in its total size of m+n, it accomodate both arrays in non decreasing order:
[1,2,3,4,5,6]; size = 6;

to do this, we can introduce another temp array called merged;
we will store all the elements in this array and then set arr1=merged;

logic:
arr1 = [1,4,5,6,0,0];
m = length of arr1 actual elements without placeholders for arr2 = 4;
arr2 = [2,3];
n = length of ar2 = 2;

i=0,j=0; run while(i<m && j<n) {

    if(arr1[i] < arr2[j])
        add arr1[i];
        i++;
    else if(arr1[i] > arr2[j] && )
        add arr2[j]
        j++;
    else
        add arr[i];
        i++;
        j++;

}

loop from i till m and add remaiing elements;
