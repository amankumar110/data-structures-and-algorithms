Input: arr = [40,10,20,30]
Output: [4,1,2,3]
Explanation: 40 is the largest element. 10 is the smallest. 20 is the second smallest. 30 is the third smallest.


for input arr, the sorted arr will be : [10,20,30,40];
for rank of each number in input arr is its index in sorted arrangement +1;

dry run:
[40,10,20,30];
sorted = [10,20,30,40] O(n^2).

for(int i=0; i<arr.len;i++) { // O(n).
    int rank = findIndexInSorted(arr[i])+1;
    arr[i]=rank;
}

TC: O(n^2).
